= Docker Connector Release Notes

The Anypoint Connector for Docker lets you connect to the docker engine and docker registry. The connector exposes convenient methods for exploiting the capabilities of Docker.

The connector executes API calls targeting Docker’s REST API depending on you configuration. The API calls use an JSON request/response over HTTP and HTTPS connection. All required request HTTP and HTTPS connection configurations are abstracted and built into the connector.

Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector. Track feature additions, compatibility, limitations, and API version updates using the Docker Connector Release Notes. Review the connector operations and see how they work by reviewing the Technical Reference alongside the Demo Applications.
